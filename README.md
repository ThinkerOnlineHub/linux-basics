# 🧩 Linux Basics – Platform Ops Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Platform Operations Learning Journey**!  
This repository documents my daily hands-on practice in Linux, forming the foundation for my future learning in **Cloud, Containers, and DevOps**.  
Each day, I learn-by-doing and share progress publicly — one step at a time 🚀  

---

## 🎯 **Goal**
To master Linux fundamentals required for Platform Ops, DevOps, and Cloud Engineering roles.  
This journey helps me build confidence with the command line, file systems, and networking concepts — the real backbone of every production system.
