## Commands practiced / आज केलेले commands

- `pwd` — print working directory  
- `ls` — list files  
- `cd Documents` — change directory

## What I did (short) / मी काय केलं
- Opened Terminal (Mac) → navigated Documents → Downloads → Desktop → back to home.

## Output / Output screenshot (optional)
- (Attach image: day-01-screenshot.png) 

## Key learning / शिका
- `pwd` shows current path.  
- `ls` lists files.  
- `cd ..` goes one folder up.

## Issues / Doubts / अडचणी
- Tried `cd /Downloads` and got error — need to use `cd Downloads` without leading `/`.

## Next micro goal (tomorrow) / उद्याचे छोटे लक्ष्य
- Learn `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `rmdir` and practice inside a folder.


## Notes
Learned about Linux directory structure and file creation commands.

# 🧩 Platform Ops Journey – Day 01  
### Topic: Linux Basics – Introduction & File System  

---

## 🎯 Goal
Understand the structure of Linux and practice basic navigation commands.

---

## 📘 Commands Practiced

| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `pwd` | Shows current working directory |
| `ls` | Lists files and directories |
| `cd` | Changes directory |
| `mkdir` | Creates a new directory |
| `rmdir` | Removes an empty directory |

## 🧠 Learnings & Notes
- Everything in Linux is treated as a file.
- The root directory (`/`) is the top of the hierarchy.
- Practice `cd ..` to move one level up.
- Use `ls -l` for detailed file list.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Practice Activity
1. Create a directory named `test`
2. Inside it, create a file `file1.txt`
3. List and delete that file
4. Remove the `test` directory

---

## 💬 Reflection
Day 1 felt great — refreshed Linux basics after a long gap.  
Next step: explore file permissions (`chmod`, `chown`).
